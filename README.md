# theCodaCollectionCodingChallenge

Thank you for taking the time to look at my response to The Coda Collection's backend engineering coding challenge!

# Project Structure

## Java files

Inside of the controller folder you will find CodingChallengeController.java. This file sets up all endpoints for the project and manages request handling. 

Inside of the entities folder you will find five files. There is one for each table in the database used for mapping the table datastructure into a java object. Additionally, there is the ReqTitleDTO which is used for taking in the data on a request body so it can be used to create or update a title in the database.

Inside of the repository folder you will find four files. Inside of each is an interface that allows for connecitons to and queries on one of the tables in the database. 

Finally, is the service folder in which you will find CodingChallengeService.java. Which is used to handle some of the more complicated business logic of the project including things such as my abstraction of the upload_to_amazon function as well as a method for creating a new title which requires several steps.

And CodingchallengeApplication.java runs the project. 

## Resources files

The application.properties file creates and populates an in-memory H2 database.

The data.sql file holds all data to be upload into the database upon creation.

The schema.sql file creates all necessary schema (tables and sequences) for the database.

## Endpoints

By default, the project runs on port 8080

There are six endpoints created by this project:
